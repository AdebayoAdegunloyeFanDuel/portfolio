During this period I understood how videos are stored, streamed, interact with displays, and a little bit about codecs and muxers, and various video color formats (RGB, YUV and the conversions between them).

                    <span class="content">Spent my first month exploring face detection in thermal video on a low-end mobile GPU. The limited GPU computation ability and limited facial features at a distance forced me to use a HoG feature descriptor and feed its results to a linear SVM. I detected once every 10 frames and used a KLT tracker, tracking points in the detected faces as it was computationally faster.</span>

I took up electives in IoT and Software Architecture, made friends that I'll keep for life, and played a lot of football. This was a great place for me because the college gave us a lot of time and space and let us be - which is why I could experiment so many different things and figure out what I like to do most.</span>

This was when I was in 7th grade, and I'm glad we did; I know I'd be a confused brown Swiss who'd never never associate himself as an Indian, but wouldn't truly ever be one of the Swiss either because he was a brown vegetarian brought up with Indian values.
