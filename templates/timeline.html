                    <span class="content">I hired a full time Android Engineer and a Python webdev intern, and boy was it difficult. I've always stressed on a company is only as good as it's people, but it's an insanely difficult challenge to hire good engineers with the right mindset.</span>

                    <span class="content">I used Gstreamer on Android to stream real time video. During this period I understood how videos are stored, streamed, interact with displays, and a little bit about codecs and muxers, and various video color formats (RGB, YUV and the conversions between them). I also created a <a

                    <span class="content">Spent my first month exploring face detection in thermal video on a low-end mobile GPU. The limited GPU computation ability and limited facial features at a distance forced me to use a HoG feature descriptor and feed its results to a linear SVM. I detected once every 10 frames and used a KLT tracker, tracking points in the detected faces as it was computationally faster.</span>

This was when I was in 7th grade, and I'm glad we did; I know I'd be a confused brown Swiss who'd never never associate himself as an Indian, but wouldn't truly ever be one of the Swiss either because he was a brown vegetarian brought up with Indian values. Having now seen life in India, I'd like to spend my life in Europe of the US.</span>
