		<h2>Making Things</h2>		
		<p>When you first develop an application, create something using Lego, or play around with hardware, you will experience ecstasy, so exultant and euphoric that you will want to enthusiastically practice more and build somethingâ€”anything, like a hungry chef discovering a furnished kitchen with every tool, every utensil, and a stocked pantry.</p>

		<h1>Hi!</h1>
		<p>My name is Rishabh Bhardwaj and I am 20 years old, and live in Gandhinagar, India.</p>
		<p>I am currently in my Junior year at <a href="http://daiict.ac.in/">DA-IICT</a>, taking up electives majorly in the area of computer science, IoT, and cryptography.</p>
		<b><p>You can read more about me and my work <a href = "/aboutme">here</a>.</p></b>
		<p>I have gained much interest in machine learning and NLP, and enjoy gaining insights into human behaviour through data.</p>
		<p>I have been developing Android apps since my freshman summers, and continue to do so on a freelance basis. I have worked at 4 startups so far, one including an MIT Media Lab spinoff <a href="http://360.tesseract.in/">Tesseract</a>, and absolutely love the no-hierarchy work culture, heavy responsibilities, and tight schedules at startups.</p>
		<p>I love traveling and exploring (see <a href="/places">here</a>), meeting new people and discussing ideas and developing things that people will use.</p>
		<p>You can find me on <a href="http://in.linkedin.com/in/bhardwajrish/">LinkedIn</a>, or email me <a href="mailto:bhardwaj.rish@gmail.com?Subject=Hello%20Rish%20-from-website" target="_top">here</a>.
