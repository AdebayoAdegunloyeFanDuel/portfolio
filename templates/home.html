		<h2>Making Things</h2>		
		<p>When you first develop an application, create something using Lego, or play around with hardware, you will experience ecstasy, so exultant and euphoric that you will want to enthusiastically practice more and build somethingâ€”anything, like a hungry chef discovering a furnished kitchen with every tool, every utensil, and a stocked pantry.</p>

		<h1>Hi!</h1>
		<p>My name is Rishabh Bhardwaj and I am 21 years old, and live in Gandhinagar, India.</p>
		<p>I am currently in my Senior year at <a href="http://daiict.ac.in/">DA-IICT</a>, taking up electives majorly in the area of computer science and IoT.</p>
		<b><p>You can read more about me and my work <a href = "/aboutme">here</a>.</p></b>
		<p>I have been developing Android apps since my freshman summers, and continue to do so on a freelance basis. I have worked at 3 startups so far, one including an MIT Media Lab spinoff <a href="http://360.tesseract.in/">Tesseract</a>, and absolutely love the no-hierarchy work culture, heavy responsibilities, and work that demands creativity at startups.</p>
		<p>Recently, I have gained much interest in machine learning and NLP, and enjoy gaining insights into human behaviour through data. This is something I would like to study in the final year of university.</p>
		<p>I love traveling and exploring (see <a href="http://bhardwajrish.blogspot.com">here</a>), meeting new people and discussing ideas and developing things that people will use.</p>

 		<h1>Hi!</h1>
 		<p>My name is Rishabh Bhardwaj, I am 21 years old and I live in Bangalore, India.</p>
 		<p>I am currently working at <a href="http://tonboimaging.com">Tonbo Imaging</a>, a company into defense and space, where I am engaged in the Android camera stack, and fast real time computer vision algorithms on thermal video streams. I studied computer science at DA-IICT, and took up electives in IoT.</p>
 		<p>I enjoy developing software, especially when it interacts with hardware/embedded systems. In the past, I have developed an Android application from scratch which now has over 250K installs, going from designing the logo to collating content to structuring the database and rest api. I love contributing to open source - I contributed heavily to an Android launcher with over 1 million installs, and have open sourced a personal project I developed during my university days for viewing <a href="http://github.com/crearo/webmail">Zimbra Webmails on Android</a>.</p>
 		<p>I have also co-published a paper in the Conference of Data Sciences (CODS '17) studying the role of temporal diversity in inferring social ties based on spatio-temporal data. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03298">view paper here</a>).</p>
 		<p>I enjoy solo traveling - have spent 2 weeks on a solo trip to Dharamshala. I am an active blogger (<a href="http://bhardwajrish.blogspot.com">view blog here</a>), where I write my mind. I love listening to the stories every new person I meet brings with them, discussing ideas and developing things that people will use. I'm extremely enthusiastic about life, am in love with my job and am always on the hunt for learning something new.</p>
